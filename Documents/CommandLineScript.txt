This command line tool simulates the HVAC System from P3. 
It is now easier to setup and run from the command line.
The audience for this tool would be people wanting to simulate a room's temperature with specific disturbance temps and a heater.
Multiple instances of this tool could be used to simulate multiple rooms, even entire buildings.

* Explain the following command inputs:

-l {filename}  -- loads the HVAC system from a specific filename or the -s default
-s {filename}  -- saves the HVAC system from a specific filename or the default HVACSim.svbl
-r [int]       -- runs the HVAC system [int] number of times
-d [double[]]  -- sets the disturbance array to the comma separated values
-t [double]    -- sets the rooms temperature
-o {int}       -- outputs every n%{int}==0 where n is the run number
-h             -- prints out this section (including this)

The program can receive and send data using command line arguments as well as file inputs.
The file inputs must be specified using the commands presented earlier or using the default filenames.

When using -l the location of it in the command is important.
If it is used in the very beginning any changes will be applied to the loaded file, in the run.
If it is used after other commands they will be overwritten.
The -s, -o, and -r will not be overwritten as they are run independent.

* Demonstrate how the order affects the outputs
* Demonstrate changing the temp or disturbance array
