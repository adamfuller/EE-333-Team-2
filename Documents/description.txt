The backend code of our HVAC System is intended to simulate an HVAC system with variable disturbances to the rooms.
It contains objects that are representative of the components in the system and build that it is contained in.
These objects include but are not limited to: Heater, Cooler, Blower, Room, Floor, Building, Controller, Clock/Time, and Temperature Sensor.
Each of the previously named objects is intended to simulate a corresponding component of a building or HVAC system.
Our target product is going to be a visual simulation of the temperatures and state of each room and its HVAC components.
The product should allow for the user to input the temperature for each room, add rooms, and add floors, deleting floors and rooms would be very beneficial.
The simulation should capable of pausing, starting, saving its progress to a file, and resuming at a later time from a save file.
The program should have the temperatures of the rooms be affected by an ambient temperature array that represents the temperature outside of the building.
